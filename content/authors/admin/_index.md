I am a PhD student at UCL and part of the CDT in Foundational AI, working under the supervision of Marc Deisenroth. 

My research interests are in Gaussian processes, and their applications. In particular, I am excited by the application of Gaussian processes to problems in climate science. Theoretically, I am also interested in methods that help improve the computational cost of inference in high-dimensional Gaussian processes and connections between Gaussian processes and infinitely wide neural networks.
